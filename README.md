[README.pt-BR](https://github.com/marcelofmatos/phpnetmap/blob/master/README.pt-BR.md)

PHP Software for network device monitoring with
SNMP v(1/2c/3) protocol. Tested with 3Com/HP, ProCurve, Dell and Extreme devices.
Some other models with SNMP support work properly.
Framework [yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/) with
[Bootstrap](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/bootstrap)
[Colorpicker](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/colorpicker) and
[CAdvancedArBehavior](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/cadvancedarbehavior).
Using JavaScript [D3](http://d3js.org/) library  to the map.


## How It works

The PHPNetMap shows connected hosts based on the [FIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_information_base)
or table CAM switches, and [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) table 
devices. You can perform searches within these tables in various
devices with the Search form. With the map view you can check the connections 
between hosts and each host there is a screen indicating the  port status with 
their respective connected host. You can see the operating status port and 
status of the [Spanning Tree Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol) 
on switches with dot1dStpPortState OID. Using an SNMP community with read/write 
permission you can change the ifAdminStatus or set ifAlias


# PHPNetMap and Docker

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/marcelofmatos/phpnetmap.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/marcelofmatos/phpnetmap "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

I created a Docker image with all the configuration ready for use PHPNetMap,
available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcelofmatos/phpnetmap/).
With the docker-compose.yml in the project root you can download the image and run
system only with the command `docker-compose up` within the directory
project. Note server settings to run in production mode (Password in ADMIN_PASSWORD 
environment variable, for example). Change the docker-compose.yml as necessary.

## Installing Docker
```
curl -ssl https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

Create and run a single container
```
docker run -p 80:80 --name=server1 marcelofmatos/phpnetmap
```

Open a web browser and access http://<server_ip> or http://localhost if 'docker run' executed in your local machine
The HTTP user is 'admin' and password is string set in ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable.

If you wish run container in other port:
```
docker run -p 8081:80 --name=server1 marcelofmatos/phpnetmap
```
And open http://localhost:8081

To manage container:
```
docker start server1
docker stop server1
```

Set HTTP user and password:
```
docker run -p 80:80 --name=server1 -e ADMIN_USER=admin -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=pnm marcelofmatos/phpnetmap
```
If ADMIN_USER is not set, 'admin' is default value.
If ADMIN_PASSWORD is not set, a random value is set and printed on log container.

To show log container
```
docker logs server1
```

## Using with docker-compose

Use these comands to install docker-compose
```
apt-get install python-pip
pip install docker-compose
```

To run configuration in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/marcelofmatos/phpnetmap/blob/master/docker-compose.yml):
```
docker-compose up
```

To run especific YML file, like [docker-compose-multiple-servers.yml](https://github.com/marcelofmatos/phpnetmap/blob/master/docker-compose-multiple-servers.yml):
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-multiple-servers.yml up
```


# Server

The software was tested on Debian and Ubuntu Server with the following 
installed packages:

* apache2
* libapache2-mod-php5
* php5-snmp
* php5-sqlite
* php-apc
* snmpd
* sqlite3

The login is set in .htaccess and .htpasswd so apache must be configured to 
read the instructions
